# A variable is  created the moment you first assign a value to it 
x = 5 # x  is of type int 
y = "john" # x is now of type str
print(x)
print(y)

# CASTING
#  if you want to specify the data type of a variable , this can be done with casting
x = str(3) # x will be '3'
y = int(3) # y will be 3 
z = float(3) # z will be 3.0

# GET THE TYPE 
    
# you can get the data  type of a variable with the type() function 
# example
x = 5 
y = "john"
print (type(x))
print (type(y))

# CASE SENSITIVE
# variable names are case sensitive
a = 4 
A = "sally"
#A will not overwrite a
