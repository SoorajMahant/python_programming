# || output variables||
# the python print() function is often used to output  variables
x = "python is awesome"
print(x)

# in the print() function , you output multiple variables, seperated by a comma:
x = "python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x,y,z)

# you can also use the + operator to output multiple variables

x = "python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x +y +z)#when x y and z print then it cann't take any space
